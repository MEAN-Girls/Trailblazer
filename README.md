## Local Install

To get the app running on your local machine, you first need to install all prerequisites found [here](https://github.com/MEAN-Girls/Trailblazer/tree/develop/app). Once you have done that, you can clone this repository.

From the **app directory** do the following:

1.Install all of your packages and libraries by running:
```bash
$ npm install
$ bower install
```
2.Set your MONGOLAB_URI environment variable to your mongolabs uri. **DO NOT** hardcode any config files, set this via your OS.

3.You can now run your application by running:
```bash
$ grunt
```
